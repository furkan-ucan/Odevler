# Fibonacci Series Program

This Java program finds the Fibonacci series using loops. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the source code files.
3. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler:
    javac FibonacciSeries.java
4. Run the program:
    java FibonacciSeries
5. Enter the number of elements of the Fibonacci series when prompted.
6. The program will display the Fibonacci series up to the specified number of elements.

## Example

If you enter `10` as the number of elements, the program will output the following Fibonacci series:

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

The program calculates each term in the Fibonacci series by summing the previous two terms.

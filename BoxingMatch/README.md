## BoxingMatch
BoxingMatch is a Java program that simulates a boxing match between two fighters. The program uses the "fighter" and "Ring" classes to simulate the match.

# Getting Started
To run the program, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Once you have Java installed, you can run the program by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the program is located, and running the following command:java Main.java

This will start the program and run the boxing match.

# Usage
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the names, damage, health, weight, and dodge rate of the two fighters. You will also be prompted to enter the minimum and maximum weight for the match.

Once you have entered the information for the fighters, the program will start the match and simulate the hits between the fighters. The program will print messages to the console indicating when a fighter has hit the other fighter, and when a fighter has blocked a hit.

The program will continue to simulate the match until one of the fighters has no health left. The program will then print a message indicating which fighter has won the match.

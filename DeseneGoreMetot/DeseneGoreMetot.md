## Recursive Method Example
This Java program demonstrates a recursive method that subtracts 5 from a user-provided integer value until the value is less than or equal to 0. After each subtraction, the current value is printed to the console.

# Getting Started
To run this program, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the official website.

Once you have Java installed, you can compile and run the program using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
javac DeseneGoreMetot.java
java DeseneGoreMetot

# Usage
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a value for "n". Enter a positive integer value and press Enter. The program will then call the recursive method with your input value and print the current value to the console after each subtraction.

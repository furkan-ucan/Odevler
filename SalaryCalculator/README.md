# SalaryCalculator
SalaryCalculator is a Java program that calculates the salary of an employee based on their hourly rate and the number of hours they worked.

## Getting Started
To run the program, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Once you have Java installed, you can run the program by opening a terminal or command prompt, navigating to the directory where the program is located, and running the following command: java SalaryCalculator.java

This will start the program and prompt you to enter the hourly rate and the number of hours worked for the employee.

## Usage
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the hourly rate and the number of hours worked for the employee. Once you have entered the information, the program will calculate the salary of the employee based on the following formula:
    salary = hourly rate * number of hours worked
The program will then print the calculated salary to the console.
